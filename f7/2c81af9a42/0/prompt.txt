Backend API, Database & Deployment (Python + FastAPI)

*Branch:* feature/backend-api

### Responsibilities
- FastAPI app entry point (server/main.py) — register routers, CORS, startup event
- database.py — SQLite3 connection using SQLAlchemy, Base, get_db dependency, auto table creation on startup
- models.py — SQLAlchemy ORM models: User, Project, Plot
- schemas.py — Pydantic schemas for all request bodies and response shapes
- auth.py — JWT creation/verification using python-jose, password hashing with passlib[bcrypt]
- dependencies.py — get_current_user() and admin_only() FastAPI dependencies
- All three routers: routers/auth.py, routers/projects.py, routers/plots.py
- services/plot_division.py — *auto plot division algorithm* (core logic)
- requirements.txt and .env.example
- Deployment: Render or Railway for backend, Vercel for frontend

### Auto Plot Division Algorithm (services/plot_division.py)
When POST /api/projects is called with land_length, land_width, num_plots:
1. Compute best grid fit: cols = ceil(sqrt(num_plots)), rows = ceil(num_plots / cols)
2. Individual plot: plot_length = land_length / cols, plot_width = land_width / rows
3. Loop through grid positions, assign row_index, col_index, facing direction, area
4. Bulk insert all plot records into SQLite3 via SQLAlchemy
5. Return full project + plots in response
